\arguments{
\item{se.obj}{A summarized experiment object.}

\item{assay.name}{A name of the assays in summarized experiment object.}

\item{uv.variable}{String of the label of a continuous or categorical variable.
such as samples types, batch or library size from colData(se) that will be used to define PRPS.}

\item{bio.variable}{String of the label of a categorical variable that specifies major biological groups
such as samples types from colData(se).}

\item{min.sample.prps}{Numeric. The minimum number of homogeneous biological groups to create pseudo-sample.}

\item{apply.log}{Logical. Indicates whether to apply a log-transformation to the data.}

\item{pseudo.count}{Numeric. A pseudo count to add to each gene before applying log.}

\item{remove.na}{TO BE DEFINED.}

\item{assess.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to assess the SummarizedExperiment class object.
By default it is set to TRUE.}

\item{save.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to save the result in the metadata of the SummarizedExperiment class
object 'se.obj' or to output the result, by default it is set to TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Indicates whether to show or reduce the level of output or messages displayed during the execution of the functions, by default it is set to TRUE.}
}
\value{
SummarizedExperiment A SummarizedExperiment object containing the PRPS data or just PRPS data.
}
