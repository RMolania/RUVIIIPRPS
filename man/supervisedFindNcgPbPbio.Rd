\arguments{
\item{se.obj}{A SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{assay.name}{Symbol.Indicates a name of assay in the SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{bio.variables}{Symbols.Indicates the columns names that contains biological variables in the SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{uv.variables}{Symbols.Indicates the columns names that contains UV variables in the SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{nb.ncg}{Numeric. Indicates the percentage of the total genes to be selected a NCG set,
by default it is set to 10 percent.}

\item{ncg.selection.method}{Symbol.Indicates how to select a set genes as NCG.
For individual genes, the two-way ANOVA calculates F-statistics for biological and
unwanted variation factors separately. An ideal NCG set should have high F-statistics
for the unwanted variation variables and low F-statistics for the biological variables.
The function ranks the F-statistics obtained for the biological variable and negative of
the F-statistics obtained for the unwanted variables. Then this functions offers 5 ways to
summarize the ranks of the two F-statistics. Prod' is the product of the ranks. 'Sum', is
the sum of the ranks. 'Average' is the average of the ranks. 'AbsNoneOverlap' is the none overlapped
genes of the 'top.rank.uv.genes' and 'top.rank.bio.genes'. 'noneOverlap' is the none overlapped genes
of the 'top.rank.uv.genes' and at least 'top.rank.bio.genes'. The F-statistics for biological and UV
are first ranked.Then options are Prod (product), Sum, Average,}

\item{grid.nb}{Numeric. Indicates the percentage for grid search when the ncg.selection.method is
'noneOverlap'. In the 'noneOverlap' approach, the grid search starts with the initial
'top.rank.uv.genes' value an add the grid.nb in each loop to find the 'nb.ncg'.}

\item{top.rank.bio.genes}{Numeric.Indicates the percentage of top ranked genes that are highly affected
by the biological variation. This is required to be specified when the 'ncg.selection.method' is
either 'noneOverlap' or 'AbsNoneOverlap'.}

\item{top.rank.uv.genes}{Numeric.Indicates the percentage of top ranked genes that are highly affected
by the unwanted variation variables. This is required to be specified when the 'ncg.selection.method' is
either 'noneOverlap' or 'AbsNoneOverlap'.}

\item{bio.groups}{TBBB}

\item{bio.clustering.method}{Symbols.Indicates which clustering methods should be used to group continuous sources of biological variation.}

\item{nb.bio.clusters}{Numeric.Indicates the number of clusters for each continuous  sources of biological variation, by default it is set to 2.}

\item{uv.groups}{TBBB}

\item{uv.clustering.method}{Symbols.Indicates which clustering method should be used to group continuous sources of UV.}

\item{nb.uv.clusters}{Numeric.Indicates the number of clusters for each continuous sources of UV, by default it is set to 2.}

\item{normalization}{TBBB}

\item{regress.out.uv.variables}{TBBB}

\item{regress.out.bio.variables}{TBBB}

\item{apply.log}{Logical. Indicates whether to apply a log-transformation to the data, by default it is set to TRUE.}

\item{pseudo.count}{Numeric. A value as a pseudo count to be added to all measurements before log transformation.}

\item{min.sample.for.aov}{TBBB}

\item{min.sample.for.correlation}{TBBB}

\item{corr.method}{TBBB}

\item{a}{The significance level used for the confidence intervals in the correlation, by default it is set to 0.05.}

\item{rho}{The value of the hypothesised correlation to be used in the hypothesis testing, by default it is set to 0.}

\item{anova.method}{TBBB}

\item{assess.ncg}{Logical. Indicates whether to assess the performance of selected NCG or not.
This analysis involves principal component analysis on the selected NCG and
then explore the R^2 or vector correlation between the 'nb.pcs' first principal
components and with biological and unwanted variables.}

\item{variables.to.assess.ncg}{Symbols. Indicates the column names of the SummarizedExperiment object that
contain variables whose association with the selected genes as NCG.
needs to be evaluated. The default is NULL. This means all the variables in the 'bio.variables' and 'uv.variables' will be assessed.}

\item{nb.pcs}{Numeric. Indicates the number of the first principal components on selected NCG to be used to assess the performance of NCGs.}

\item{scale}{Logical. Indicates whether to scale the data before applying Principal component analysis. The default is FALSE.}

\item{center}{Logical. Indicates whether to center the data before applying principal component analysis or not. The default is TRUE.}

\item{assess.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to assess the SummarizedExperiment class object or not.}

\item{assess.variables}{TBBB}

\item{remove.na}{Symbol. Indicates whether to remove NA or missing values from either the 'assays', the 'sample.annotation',
'both' or 'none'. If 'assays' is selected, the genes that contains NA or missing values will be excluded. If 'sample.annotation' is selected, the
samples that contains NA or missing values for any 'bio.variables' and 'uv.variables' will be excluded. By default, it is set to both'.}

\item{save.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to save the result in the metadata of the SummarizedExperiment class object 'se.obj' or
to output the result. By default it is set to TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Indicates whether to show or reduce the level of output or messages displayed during the execution
of the functions, by default it is set to TRUE.}
