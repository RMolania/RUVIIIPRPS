\arguments{
\item{se.obj}{A summarized experiment object.}

\item{uv.variables}{String of the label of unwanted variation variables to specify major groups with respect to unwanted variation.}

\item{nb.clusters}{A value to specify the number of groups of continuous sources of biological variation.}

\item{clustering.method}{A clustering method to group each continuous sources of biological variation.}

\item{assess.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to assess the SummarizedExperiment class object.}

\item{assess.variables}{Logical. Indicates whether to assess association between the biological variables.}

\item{cat.cor.coef}{Correlation coefficients (Cramer's V, Pearson's contingency coefficient) cut off for assessing association between categorical sources of biological variation.}

\item{cont.cor.coef}{Spearman coefficients cut off for assessing association between continuous sources of biological variation.}

\item{remove.na}{To remove NA or missing values from either the assays or sample annotation or both.}

\item{save.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to save the results to SummarizedExperiment object or not.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to show the messages of the functions or not.}
