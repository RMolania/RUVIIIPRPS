\usage{
plotSilhouette(
  se.obj,
  assay.names = "all",
  variables,
  silhouette.method = "sil.euclidian",
  plot.type = "single.plot",
  plot.output = TRUE,
  save.se.obj = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{se.obj}{A SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{assay.names}{Symbol. A symbol or list of symbols for the selection of the name(s) of the assay(s) in the
SummarizedExperiment object to generate barplot or scatter plots of the computed adjusted rand index. By default all
the assays of the SummarizedExperiment object will be selected.}

\item{variables}{Symbol. Indicates one or two column names in the SummarizedExperiment object that contains categorical
variables such as sample subtypes or batches.}

\item{silhouette.method}{Symbol. Indicates what computed ARI methods should be used for plotting. The "ari.method" must be
specified based on the "computeARI" function. The default is "hclust.complete.euclidian", which is the default of the
the "computeARI" function. We refer to the "computeARI" function for more detail}

\item{plot.type}{Symbol.Indicates how to plot the adjusted rand index. The options are "single.plot" and "combined.plot".
If a variable is provided, then the "plot.type" must be set to "single.plot", so, the function generates a barplot of the
adjusted rand index. If two variables are provided and "plot.type" is set to "combined.plot", then the function generates
a scatter plot of the adjusted rand index of each variable against each other.}

\item{plot.output}{Logical. If TRUE, the individual barplots or scatter plots will be printed while functions is running.}

\item{save.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to save the plots in the metadata of the SummarizedExperiment  object
or to output the result as list. By default it is set to TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displaying process messages is enabled.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object or a list that containing all the plots of the computed average Silhouette coefficients
on the categorical variable.
}
\description{
This functions generates barplots of average Silhouette coefficients for individual assays. If two variables are provided, the
function creates scatter plots of the average Silhouette coefficients of each variable for the individual assays.
