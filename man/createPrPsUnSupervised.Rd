\arguments{
\item{se.obj}{A SummarizedExperiment object.}

\item{assay.name}{Symbol. A symbol indicating the assay name within the SummarizedExperiment object for the creation
of PRPS data. The assay must be the one that will be used as data input for the RUV-III-PRPS normalization.}

\item{approach}{Symbol. Indicates which method to be used.}

\item{uv.variables}{Symbol. A symbol specifying the name of columns in the sample annotation of the SummarizedExperiment
object. This variable can to be categorical or continuous variable. If a continuous variable is provide, this will be
divided into groups using the clusteintf method.}

\item{clustering.method}{Symbol.A symbol indicating the choice of clustering method for grouping the 'uv.variable'
if a continuous variable is provided. Options include 'kmeans', 'cut', and 'quantile'. The default is set to 'kmeans'.}

\item{nb.clusters}{Numeric. A numeric value indicating how many clusters should be found if the 'uv.variable' is a
continuous variable. The default is 3.}

\item{hvg}{Vector. A vector containing the names of highly variable genes. These genes will be utilized to identify
anchor samples across different batches. The default value is set to 'NULL'}

\item{anchor.features}{Numeric. A numeric value indicating the provided number of features to be used in anchor finding.
The default is 2000. We refer to the FindIntegrationAnchors R function for more details.}

\item{scale}{Logical. Whether or not to scale the features provided. Only set to FALSE if you have previously scaled
the features you want to use for each object in the object.list.}

\item{min.prps.samples}{Numeric. The minimum number of samples to be averaged to create a pseudo-sample. The default
is 3. The minimum value is 2.}

\item{max.prps.samples}{Numeric value indicating the maximum number of samples to be averaged for creating a pseudo-sample.
The default is 'inf'. Please note that averaging a high number of samples may lead to inaccurate PRPS estimates.}

\item{max.prps.sets}{Numeric. The maximum number of PRPS sets across batches. The default in 10.}

\item{min.score}{Numeric. A cut off to filter anchors based the scores that the FindIntegrationAnchors calculates.
The default is NULL, indicating no filtration will be applied based on the scores. The value is between 0 or 1.}

\item{normalization.method}{Symbol. Indicate which normalization methods should be used before finding the anchors.
The options are "LogNormalize" or "SCT". The default is "LogNormalize".}

\item{sct.clip.range}{Numeric. Numeric of length two specifying the min and max values the Pearson residual will be
clipped to. The default is 'NULL'. We refer to the FindIntegrationAnchors R function for more details.}

\item{reduction}{Symbol. Indicates which dimensional reduction to perform when finding anchors. The options are "cca":
canonical correlation analysis, "rpca": reciprocal PCA and "rlsi": Reciprocal LSI. The default is "cca".}

\item{l2.norm}{Logical. Indicates whether to perform L2 normalization on the CCA samples embeddings after dimensional
reduction or not. The default is 'TRUE'.}

\item{dims}{Numeric. Indicates which dimensions to use from the CCA to specify the neighbor search space. Th default
is 10.}

\item{k.anchor}{Numeric. How many neighbors (k) to use when picking anchors. Th default is 3.}

\item{k.filter}{Numeric. How many neighbors (k) to use when filtering anchors. Th default is 200.}

\item{k.score}{Numeric. How many neighbors (k) to use when scoring anchors. Th default is 30.}

\item{max.features}{Numeric. The maximum number of features to use when specifying the neighborhood search space in
the anchor filtering.Th default is 30.}

\item{nn.method}{Symbol.Method for nearest neighbor finding. Options include: "rann", "annoy". The defauly is "annoy".}

\item{n.trees}{Numeric. More trees gives higher precision when using annoy approximate nearest neighbor search}

\item{eps}{Numeric. Error bound on the neighbor finding algorithm (from RANN/Annoy)}

\item{data.input}{Symbol. Indicates which data should be used an input for finding the k nearest neighbors data. Options
include: 'expr' and 'pcs'. If 'pcs' is selected, the first PCs of the data will be used as input. If 'expr' is selected,
the data will be selected as input.}

\item{nb.pcs}{Numeric. Indicates the number PCs should be used as data input for finding the k nearest neighbors. The
'nb.pcs' must be set when the "data.input = PCs". The default is 2.}

\item{center.pca}{Logical. Indicates whether to scale the data or not. If center is TRUE, then centering is done by
subtracting the column means of the assay from their corresponding columns. The default is TRUE.}

\item{scale.pca}{Logical. Indicates whether to scale the data or not before applying SVD.  If scale is TRUE, then scaling
is done by dividing the (centered) columns of the assays by their standard deviations if center is TRUE, and the root
mean square otherwise. The default is FALSE}

\item{svd.bsparam}{A BiocParallelParam object specifying how parallelization should be performed. The default is bsparam().
We refer to the 'runSVD' function from the BiocSingular R package.}

\item{k.nn}{Numeric.The maximum number of nearest neighbors to compute. The default is set 3.}

\item{normalization}{Symbol. Indicates which normalization methods should be applied before finding the knn. The default
is 'cpm'. If is set to NULL, no normalization will be applied.}

\item{regress.out.bio.variables}{Symbols. Indicates the columns names that contain biological variables in the
SummarizedExperiment object. These variables will be regressed out from the data before finding genes that are highly
affected by unwanted variation variable. The default is NULL, indicates the regression will not be applied.}

\item{apply.log}{Logical. Indicates whether to apply a log-transformation to the data or not. The default is 'TRUE'.}

\item{pseudo.count}{Numeric. A value as a pseudo count to be added to all measurements of the assay before applying
log transformation to avoid -Inf for raw counts that are equal to 0. The default is 1.}

\item{mnn.bpparam}{Symbol. A BiocParallelParam object specifying how parallelization should be performed to find MNN.
. The default is SerialParam(). We refer to the 'findMutualNN' function from the 'BiocNeighbors' R package.}

\item{assess.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to assess the SummarizedExperiment object or not. See the checkSeObj
function for more details.}

\item{remove.na}{Symbol. To remove NA or missing values from the assays or not. The options are 'assays' and 'none'.
The default is "assays", so all the NA or missing values from the assay(s) will be removed before computing RLE. See
the checkSeObj function for more details.}

\item{save.se.obj}{Logical. Indicates whether to save the RLE results in the metadata of the SummarizedExperiment
object or to output the result as list. By default it is set to TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If 'TRUE', shows the messages of different steps of the function.}

\description{
This function uses the 'createUnSupervisedPRPSbyAnchors' or 'createUnSupervisedPRPSbyMNN' to create PRPS sets of all
the unwanted variables in situations when the biological variation are unknown.
