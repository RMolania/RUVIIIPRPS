Description: We propose a strategy, called pseudo-replicates of pseudo-samples (PRPS), for deploying our recently developed normalization method, called removing unwanted variation III (RUV-III), to remove the variation caused by library size, tumor purity and batch effects in TCGA RNA-seq data. RUV-III with PRPS can be used to integrate and normalize other large transcriptomic datasets coming from multiple laboratories or platforms.
